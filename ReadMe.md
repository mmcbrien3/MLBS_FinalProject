# Machine Learning for Biosciences Final Project
### Authors: Matt McBrien, Alexandra Melehan, Matt Munns

This repository includes code for a PyGame game and a reinforcement learning
algorithm that attempts to learn how to play it using genetic mutations of
neural networks.

Game code is included in src/game/ and the reinforcement learning code is
included in src/ml/

## Install and Run Steps

* requires python>=3.6.8
* pip install -r requirements.txt
